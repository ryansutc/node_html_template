*******************
Quick Scratch Pad of issues and outstanding todos
*******************

1) cache-busting is not deleting OLD version of js/css files

2) Find/Replace on HTML in build when fingerprint changes for resources is causing html not to recognize changes from source because source file is no longer newer.

- css changes (html is changed in build)
- html in source changes (html calls css to update?)

Does html need to call js, css each time and if so can these tasks just pass if there is nothing changed?

3) CSS Plugins for postcss are set up?
