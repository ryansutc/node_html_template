## Vanilla Template Setup of HTML, SASS and Node with Gulp Configuration

Used to test out a basic node web project:
    * using npm for javascript libraries (ie. fullcalendar.js, jquery)
    * using gulp as a taskrunner to build project for dev and production
    * using browserify to package up node javascript for use on a basic server
    * using watchify to monitor javascript and auto-repack during development

Hoping this will be the standard workflow for vanilla HTML projects
